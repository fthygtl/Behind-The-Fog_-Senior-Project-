# Fog and Dehaze Remover

Project that focueses on:
1- integrating all the Well known dehazing algorithms to the one porgram 
2- Relasing our resarch results from this project. 
3- Gave resarchers a program that can be easly used for resarches
4- People with hazy images can dehaze their photos and have it from the program

There are also some clasified aims. Could be anounced at the future.

cd Fog_and_Haze_Remover
python main.py
```
